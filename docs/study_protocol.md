# ALCIE User Study Protocol

## Participant Instructions

### Overview
You will evaluate fashion image captions generated by three different AI models. Your task is to rate the quality and accuracy of captions for fashion items.

### Study Process

1. **View Fashion Image**: You'll see a fashion item (bag, dress, shoes, etc.)
2. **Read Three Captions**: Each generated by a different AI model
3. **Rate Each Caption**: Score 1-5 based on:
   - Accuracy of description
   - Completeness of details
   - Natural language quality
   - Overall usefulness
4. **Repeat**: 24 images total (approximately 15-20 minutes)

### Rating Scale

- **5 - Excellent**: Perfect description, natural language, comprehensive details
- **4 - Good**: Accurate with minor issues, mostly complete
- **3 - Fair**: Generally accurate but missing details or awkward phrasing
- **2 - Poor**: Some accuracy but significant issues
- **1 - Very Poor**: Inaccurate, incomplete, or incomprehensible

### Tips for Good Evaluation

- Focus on **accuracy** - does the caption match what you see?
- Consider **completeness** - are important details included?
- Evaluate **naturalness** - does it sound like human-written text?
- Be **consistent** in your rating criteria across all images

### Technical Details

- **Time Commitment**: 15-20 minutes
- **Images**: 24 fashion items
- **Categories**: Accessories, Bottoms, Dresses, Outerwear, Shoes, Tops
- **Anonymized**: You won't know which model generated which caption
